Dear ...,
thank you very much for your clear corrections and comments.
It took me some time to read the language A&A guide and to find the right tool to do the corrections (latexdiff). I would like to know if you have any suggestion of spellchecker plugin for vs-code (me),
and for Overleaf (co-authors).
Sincerely we intended to present the paper in British english language, but it seems that we misspelled some words at the beginning making the confusion towards American english.

I have uploaded a revised version of the manuscript named "approved.tex" as well as a "diff.pdf" file that contains the differences between the present revised version and your original file named "48626corr.tex".
We would really appreciate if you could make a final revision of our new manuscript.

Additionally of the modifications shown in the difference file, below I write some comments:

- In the introduction I changed some recent (<10 years) results form other authors to present tense. Ok?
- We noticed that when referring to the MW, it is not correct to say "Galactocentric", instead of "galactocentric". Is it a rule from A&A?
- In the introduction: Method -> Methods.  Is Ok?
- Most of the your text says "a MW" but one case said "an MW". Which is the right way? I allways read MW as Milky Way, not as "Em-DoubleU", but I am not sure what is the typical situation.
- At the beginnin of section 2.3, when you corrected "... used the Galactic model fit by ...",
fit is a noun? Because I would think that should go "... fitted by ..." as verb in past. No?
- In this sentence:
"The Fermionic-MW and NFW-MW models both fit the GD-1 stream very well."
Why is needed the word "both"? Is it redundant or needed for reinforcement?

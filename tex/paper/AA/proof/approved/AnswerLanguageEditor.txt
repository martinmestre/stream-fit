Dear ...,
thank you very much for your clear corrections and comments.
It took me some time to read the language A&A guide and to find the right tool to do the corrections (latexdiff). I would like to know if you have any suggestion of spellchecker plugin for vs-code (me),
and for Overleaf (co-authors).
Sincerely we intended to present the paper in British english language, but it seems that we misspelled some words at the beginning making the confusion towards American english.
I have uploaded a revised version of the manuscript named "approved.tex" as well as a "diff.pdf" file that contains the differences between the present revised version and your original file named "48626corr.tex".

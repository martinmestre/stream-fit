Dear Editor,
we would like that the language editor, Astrid Peter, revises again our corrections.
Below I write some comments.
Thank you,
best.

Dear Astrid Peter,

thank you very much for your clear corrections and comments.
It took me some time to read the language A&A guide and to find the right tool (latexdiff)
to apply the corrections. I would like to know if you have any suggestion of spellchecker
plugin for vs-code (me), and for Overleaf (co-authors).
Sincerely we intended to present the paper in British english language, but it seems that we misspelled some words at the beginning making the confusion towards American english.

I have uploaded a revised version of the manuscript named "approved.tex" (and a modified ref.bib due to an additinal reference) as well as a "diff.pdf" file that contains the differences between the present revised version and your original file named "48626corr.tex".
We would really appreciate if you could make a final revision of our new manuscript.

Additionally of the modifications shown in the difference file, below I write some doubts and comments. I thank you a lot in advance.

- In the introduction I changed some recent (age <10 years) results form other authors to present tense. Ok?

- We noticed that when referring to the MW, it is not correct to say "Galactocentric", instead of "galactocentric". Is it a rule from A&A?

- In the introduction: Method -> Methods.  Is Ok?

- Most of the your text says "a MW" but one case said "an MW". Which is the right way? I allways read MW as Milky Way, not as "Em-DoubleU", but I am not sure what is the typical situation.

- In this sentence:
"The Fermionic-MW and NFW-MW models both fit the GD-1 stream very well."
Why is needed the word "both"? Is it redundant or needed for reinforcement?

- What is the difference between "stream-fit" and "stream-fitting", when using as adjectives of the noun "procedure" ?

- Which is correct: "distribution of the fit parameters" or "distribution of the fitted parameters"
If the word is acting as an adjective, shouldn't it be "fitted"? Or it is acting as verb in past, with passive voice implicit ? In that case it is "fit" in american as far as I understand.

- I use the single tilde to mean "of the same order of magnitude" and the double tilde to mean "approximately". Is that right?

- "... the observed sky position, the proper motion, and the radial velocity." is the right way
to say that proper motion and radial velocity are also "observed".
Why is wrong to say: "... the observed sky position, proper motion, and radial velocity." ?

- Is ok to say "...is capable of agreeing with..." or "...is able to agree with..." ?

- In a paragraph of Sec. 3.2 we applied a small rewording and added a recent reference.

Thank you very much.
Best regards.

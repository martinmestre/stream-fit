   {Stellar streams are a consequence of the tidal forces produced by a host galaxy on its satellites (i.e. globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals).
   As the self-gravity of stellar streams is almost negligible, they constitute excellent probes of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. For this reason, some Milky Way stellar streams have been used to put constraints on the dark matter (DM) total mass and shape, under empirical DM distributions (i.e. NFW, logarithmic, etc). Within the set of non-empirical DM distributions, there exists a DM model
   deduced from first principles by means of the maximization of the coarse-grained entropy for self-gravitating fermions, the MEPP, after Maximum Entropy Production Principle. MEPP profiles have a rich
   variety of behaviours, being a large subfamily characterized by a dense core of mass

\section{Introduction}
When a galaxy hosts a satellite, i.e. dwarf galaxy or globular cluster, the gravitional interaction
between them modifies both subsystems. The host galaxy strips stars from the satellite at a rate
that depends on their density profiles and on the orbit,
while the host density profile suffers a reorganization of its matter in the vecinity of the satellite's orbit, developing a wake due to the dynamical friction.
This ensemble of stars tidally stripped from the satellite constitute a stellar stream (also named tidal stream) and examples of them have been detected in the Milky Way (MW) and in Andromeda, with different observational techniques.

At present stellar streams constitute one of the main MW observables related to the dynamics, together with other baryonic observables like the rotation curve, the radial surface density profile of the disk and the vertical density profile of the disk at the solar radius.
Tidal streams probe the acceleration field produced by the Galaxy~\citep{1999ApJ...512L.109J,1999A&A...348L..49Z,2009ApJ...703L..67L,2013MNRAS.436.2386L,2016ASSL..420..169J,Ibata_2016,2017ApJ...842..120I,2017A&A...603A..65T,2021MNRAS.502.4170R} as well as its formation history according to ~\citet{1999Natur.402...53H,2020ARA&A..58..205H,2022A&A...666A..64R,2023arXiv230708730C} among others.
{\it A stellar stream could be the most faithful realization of a galactic orbit that can be observed in nature}.
Nevertheless, the larger the progenitor, the more discrepancy between its orbit and the stream phase-space configuration. In fact, the taxonomy of streams is very rich~\citep{2015MNRAS.450..575A} because of the different gravitational configurations that can take place, going from almost unidimensional streams whose progenitor is a small globular cluster to a wide shell produced by the partially radial sinking into the MW centre of a large progenitor.

Stream data together with other baryonic measurements can help in making claims about unknown aspects of the gravitational field: model either a dark matter (DM) halo component or a modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory.
For example, within the DM paradigm, a given candidate to the DM particle corresponds to certain family of halo and subhalo phase-space distributions, which in turn, are responsible for the satellite orbit and the phase-space density distribution of the stream. Besides, DM space densities might have different shapes
(e.g.~spherical, axisymmetric, triaxial) depending on the number of conserved components of the angular momentum, which also incluences the stream properties as discussed in~\citet{2013ApJ...773L...4V,2020MNRAS.492.4398M}.
In particular, \citet{2019MNRAS.486.2995M} have constrained the MW dark matter halo shape using Gaia DR2 data of the the GD-1 stream, assumming a triaxial generalization of the NFW profile and obtaining a flattening halo parameter of $q=0.82^{+0.25}_{-0.13}$, thus compatible with a situation of spherical symmetry.
Moreover, \citep{2023MNRAS.524.2124P} has measured the oblateness in an axisymmetric generalization of the NFW profile using three stellar streams: NGC~3201, M68 and Palomar~5.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
In this section we explain the observables and methods used in this research.
The exact pipeline applied in order to obtain the results and plots of this paper
can be found at the following GitHub repository:
\url{https://github.com/martinmestre/stream-fit/blob/main/pipeline_paper/}.

\subsection{Observables and assumed measurements}
\label{sec:observables}

The main observables used in this project are materialized by the polynomial fits performed by
\citet{Ibata_2020} on the GD-1\\ stream using astrometry (Gaia DR2), photometry and high-precision spectroscopy datasets together with the analysis of the {\sc streamfinder} algorithm.
Those polinomials are the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \label{Ibata_polyn}
   \phi_2  &=& 0.008367\phi_1^3-0.05332\phi_1^2-0.07739\phi_1-0.02007, \\
   D &=& -4.302\phi_1^5-11.54\phi_1^4-7.161\phi_1^3 +5.985\phi_1^2 \nonumber\\
      &&+ 8.595\phi_1+10.36,\\
   \tilde{\mu}_\alpha &=& 3.794\phi_1^3+9.467\phi_1^2+1.615\phi_1-7.844,\\
   \mu_\delta &=& -1.225\phi_1^3+8.313\phi_1^2+18.68\phi_1-3.95,\\
   v_h &=&  90.68\phi_1^3+204.5\phi_1^2-254.2\phi_1-261.5,\\
   \label{Ibata_polynb}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ in radians, $D$ in kpc, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha=\mu_\alpha cos \delta$ and $\mu_\delta$ in mas/yr and $v_h$ in km/s. These quantities correspond respectively to longitude and latitude in GD-1 celestial frame of reference~\citep{Koposov_2010}, heliocentric distance, proper motion in right ascension and declination, and heliocentric radial velocity.
The domain of this polinomials is limited to $-90<\phi_1[^\circ]<10$.
To have our observable data points we sample the domain with 100 points ($\phi_1^{(i)}$ for $i=1,...,100$)
and evaluate the polinomials there in order to have a complete set of observables ($\phi_1^{(i)}$, $\phi_2^{(i)}$, $D^{(i)}$, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha^{(i)}$, $\mu_\delta^{(i)}$, $v_h^{(i)}$).
In one of the experiments we will consider an observable of a different nature
and related to the density concentration at the origin, of size $\lesssim 1$ milliparsec,
characteristic of the fermionic halo distribution. By convention, the core radius is defined
as the radius when the circular velocity reaches its first maximum.
The constraint for the mass of the core of the distribution is assumed to be $m_{\rm{core}}=3.5\times10^6 M_\odot$ in agreement with~\citet{2020A&A...641A..34B,2021MNRAS.505L..64B,2022MNRAS.511L..35A}.

The assumed measurements used in this paper are the
galactocentric distance of the sun $R_\odot=8.122$ kpc~\citep{2018A&A...615L..15G} and the sun's peculiar
velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_{\odot p} = (11.1, 12.24, 7.25)$ km/s~\citep{Shonrich}.


\subsection{The relativistic fermionic King DM model}
Our DM model consists of the relativistic fermionic King model (here denoted just ``fermionic'') which is a spherical and isotropic distribution of fermions at finite temperature in hydrostatic equilibrium subject to the law of General Relativity (GR), i.e. T.O.V equations, as defined in~\cite{arguelles_novel_2018} with the particularity that we have made a few change of variables in order to make the numerical computation more robust. The system of equations thus obtained is as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
   \label{sode}
   \frac{d\nu}{d\zeta} & = & \frac{1}{2}\left[e^{z}+e^{2\zeta}\frac{P(r)}{\rho_{rel}c^2}\right][1-e^{z}]^{-1},\\
   \frac{dz}{d\zeta} & = &-1+e^{(2\zeta-z)}\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{rel}},
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
   \zeta &=& \ln(r/R),\\
   z &=&\ln\psi,\quad \psi = \frac{M_{\rm{DM}}(r)}{M}\frac{R}{r},\label{mass_dm}\\
   \rho(r)&=&\frac{4\rho_{\rm rel}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int^\infty_1\epsilon^2[\epsilon^2-1]^{1/2}f(r,\epsilon)d\epsilon,\\
   P(r)&=&\frac{4\rho_{\rm rel}c^2}{3\sqrt{\pi}}\int^\infty_1[\epsilon^2-1]^{3/2}f(r,\epsilon)d\epsilon,\\
   R^2 &=& \frac{c^2}{8\pi G \rho_{\rm{rel}}},\\
   M &=& 4\pi R^3 \rho_{\rm{rel}},\\
   \rho_{\rm{rel}}&=& \frac{ G\pi^{3/2} m^4 c^3}{h^3},
\end{eqnarray}
where $G$ is the Gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $h$ is the Planck constant, $m$ is the fermion mass, $M_{\rm{DM}}(r)$ is DM mass enclosed up to radius $r$, $\rho(r)$ is the density, $P(r)$ is the pressure and $\nu(r)$ is the metric exponent, i.e. we use the convention $g_{00}=e^{\nu(r)}$. The phase-space function ($f$) is given by a Fermi-Dirac distribution with energy cutoff:
\begin{equation}
f(r,\epsilon)=
   \begin{cases}
      \frac{\displaystyle{1-e^{[\epsilon-\epsilon_c(r)]/\beta(r)}}}
      {\displaystyle{1+e^{[\epsilon-\alpha(r)]/\beta(r)}}}\quad \epsilon \leq \epsilon_c(r)\\
      0\quad \epsilon > \epsilon_c(r),
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(r)$ is the chemical potential (including rest mass), $\epsilon_c(r)$ is the cutoff
energy (including rest mass) and $\beta(r)$ is the temperature variable.

The above equations should be complemented with two thermodinamic equilibrium conditions given
in~\citet{PhysRev.35.904} and~\citet{RevModPhys.21.531} together with the condition of energy conservation
along the geodesic given in~\citet{1989A&A...221....4M}:
\begin{equation}
   \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{d\alpha}{dr}=\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{d\beta}{dr}=
   \frac{1}{\epsilon_c}\frac{d\epsilon_c}{dr}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\nu}{dr}.
   \label{geod_energy}
\end{equation}

It is not possible to integrate this equations from $r=0$ because the right hand the change of variables $\zeta(r)$ is divergent at the origin. Nevertheless, it is possible
to reach the following approximations for the initial conditions at a value $r_{\rm{min}}\gtrsim 0$:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \nu(r_{\rm{min}}) &\approx& \frac{1}{6}\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_{\rm{rel}}}\left[\frac{r_{\rm{min}}}{R}\right]^2\equiv\tau, \\
   \psi(r_{\rm{min}})&\approx&\frac{1}{3}\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_{\rm{rel}}}\left[\frac{r_{\rm{min}}}{R}\right]^2=2\tau,
\end{eqnarray}
which implies
\begin{equation}
   \frac{r_{\rm{min}}}{R}=\sqrt{6\tau\frac{\rho_{\rm{rel}}}{\rho_0}},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0\equiv \rho(0)$.
It can be seen that the right hand side of Eq.~\ref{sode} does not depend on the metric so we can add
a constant $\nu_0$ to the solution in order to satisfy a condition of continuity with the Schwarzschild metric at the border of the fermion distribution, obtaining:
$$\nu_0 = 2\ln\left(\frac{\beta_b}{\beta_0}\sqrt{1-\psi_b}\right),$$
where $\psi_b$ and $\beta_b$ are quantities evaluated at the border.

The system of equations thus obtained has four free parameters: $m$, $\alpha_0=\alpha(0)$,
$\beta_0=\beta(0)$, and $\epsilon_{c0}=\epsilon_c(0)$ but in practice we will use the following related
quantities as parameters:
$m$, $\beta_0$, $\theta_0=(\alpha_0-1)/\beta_0$, and $W_0=(\epsilon_{c0}-1)/\beta_0$.

Equations~\ref{sode}-\ref{geod_energy} are solved using
a {\sc Python}~\citep{van1995python} script\footnote{\texttt{model\_def.py}}
that makes use of the {\it NumPy}~\citep{2020SciPy-NMeth} and {\it SciPy}~\citep{harris2020array} libraries. We tried all the solvers available in the latter package but the only one that
could properly integrate these equations was the \texttt{LSODA} algorithm. We used relative and absolute tolerance parameters respectively given by \texttt{rtol}$=5\times10^{-14}$ and \texttt{atol}$=0$.


\subsection{Milky Way and stream models}
\label{sec:MW_stream_models}

We model our Galaxy with a combination of the fermionic dark halo recently described, whose parameters will be determined in this work, plus a barionic component fixed and identical to the one in Model I of~\citet{2017A&A...598A..66P}. Here we name this full Galaxy model as Fermionic-MW.

Appart from our model, for some intermediary tasks, we will make use of the Galactic model fitted
by~\citet{2019MNRAS.486.2995M} which consists in the {\texttt{MWPotential2014}}
model with an axisymmetric NFW profile. This fitted model corresponds to a circular velocity at the position of the sun of
$v_c(R_\odot)=244 \pm 4 \rm{ km s}^{-1}$ and a $z-$flattening of the DM density distribution of $q_\rho=0.82^{+0.25}_{-0.13}$. Here we name this Galaxy model as NFW-MW.

As GD-1 is a dynamically cold stream, with its stars keeping a large degree of correlation, its almost
one-dimensional distribution in phase-space can be well approximated with the orbit of its progenitor.
Another facts in this direction, are that there has not been any observation of the tidal arms feature
nor of the progenitor's position~\citep{2019MNRAS.486.2995M,10.1093/mnras/sty677,10.1093/mnras/sty1338,Price-Whelan_2018}.

In the code, the orbit model is computed starting from initial conditions in spherical equatorial coordinates, ICRS frame: $\alpha$ (RA), $\delta$ (declination), $D$, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha$, $\mu_\delta$, $v_h$.
The code uses the {\it Astropy} ecosystem~\citep{astropy:2022, astropy:2018, astropy:2013} in order to transform the initial condition to galactocentric coordinates assuming a Galactocentric reference frame with the sun at the position $\boldsymbol{x}_\odot=(-R_\odot,0,0)$ and a sun's velocity given by the sum of the circular velocity at the position of the sun and
the sun's peculiar velocity: $\boldsymbol{v}_\odot=(11.1, v_c(R_\odot)+12.24, 7.25)$. The circular velocity is dependent on the model and the position and given by

\begin{eqnarray}
   v_c^2(R_\odot)&=& R_\odot||\nabla \Phi(\boldsymbol{x})||_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{x}_\odot}\nonumber\\
   &=& R_\odot||\nabla \Phi_{\rm{B}}(\boldsymbol{x})||_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{x}_\odot}+
   G \frac{M_{\rm{DM}}(R_\odot)}{R_\odot},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi$ is the total potential, $\Phi_B$ is the potential generated by the three barionic components and $M_{\rm{DM}}(r)$ was defined in Eq.~(\ref{mass_dm}). We have used the spherical symmetry property of the DM distribution in order to relate the acceleration with the enclosed mass.

A second step is to integrate the orbit forwards and backwards in time during a time interval of $\Delta t=0.2$ Gyr, starting in both cases from a given initial condition for the progenitor. In the next sections
we will explain how this initial condition was chosen for some simulations and fitted for others. The integrator used is a Runge-Kutta of order eight (\texttt{DOP853} called from {\it SciPy}'s \texttt{solve\_ivp} function) with relative and absolute tolerance parameters respectively given by
\texttt{rtol}$=5\times10^{-14}$ and \texttt{atol}$=0.5\times10^{-14}$.

After having the stream's orbit integrated, we transform the orbit to both the ICRS and the GD-1 frame of coordinates. For the latter we used the \texttt{GD1Koposov10} class defined in the Gala package~\citep{gala,adrian_price_whelan_2020_4159870} which uses the transformation matrix defined
by~\citet{Koposov_2010}.
After these two transformation we obtain the orbit expressed in the observable variables ($\phi_1$, $\phi_2$, $D$, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha$, $\mu_\delta$, $v_h$) used in Eqs.~(\ref{Ibata_polyn})-(\ref{Ibata_polynb}).
Finally, we build interpolators of these variables as a function of $\phi_1$ that will be used, together with the observed data defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:observables}, to evaluate the following $\chi^2$ stream function:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \label{chi2}
   \chi^2_{\rm{stream}} &=& \chi^2_{\phi_2} + \chi^2_{D}+ \chi^2_{\tilde{\mu}_\alpha}+ \chi^2_{\mu_\delta}+\chi^2_{v_h},\\
   \chi^2_{\eta} &=& \frac{1}{\sigma_\eta^2}\sum_{i=1}^{100} \Big(\eta^{(i)}-\eta(\phi_1^{(i)})\Big)^2,
\end{eqnarray}
where
$\eta$ represents each of the four corresponding independent variables ($\phi_2$, $D$, $v_h$, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha$, $\mu_\delta$) and $\sigma_\eta$ is the average dispersion of the stream data points taken by
ocular inspection from Figs.~1,3,4 of~\citet{Ibata_2020}:
$\sigma_{\phi_2}=0.5^\circ$,
$\sigma_{D}= 1.5~\rm{kpc}$,
$\sigma_{v_h} = 10~\rm{km/s}$ and
$\sigma_{\tilde{\mu}_\alpha}= \sigma_{\delta}= 2~\rm{mas/yr}$.
Thus $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}$ measures the departure of the model from the stream observations.
For some fits we will also consider the departure of the model from a dark mass constraint in the core
of the distribution:
\begin{equation}
   \label{m_core}
   \chi^2_{\rm{core}}=\frac{(m_c-m_{\rm{core}})^2}{\sigma_m^2},
\end{equation}
where $m_{\rm{core}}$ was defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:observables}, $m_c$ is the core mass of the model, and
$\sigma_m$ was fixed in 1\% of $m_{\rm{core}}$, so sometimes we will use the following compound function:
\begin{equation}
   \label{chi2_full}
   \chi^2_{\rm{full}}=\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}+\chi^2_{\rm{core}}.
\end{equation}

Note that in order to compute the estimated core mass of each model, $m$ in Eq.(\ref{m_core}),
we must find the first local maximum of the expression for the circular velocity in GR:
\begin{equation}
   \label{v_circ_dm}
   v_{\rm{DM}}(r)= c\sqrt{\frac{r}{2}\frac{d\nu(r)}{dr}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization algorithms}
\label{sec:optimization}

Our objective consists in fitting our MW model by minimizing the $\chi^2$ function given by Eqs.~(\ref{chi2},\ref{chi2_full}).  In order to do so we use two optimization algorithms for different purposes
that will be explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}.
One of them is {\it SciPy}'s
\texttt{optimize.differential\_evolution} algorithm. This genetic architecture
was used with metaparemeters given by
\texttt{strategy}=\texttt{"best2bin"}, \texttt{maxiter}=200, \texttt{popsize}=200,
\texttt{tol}=$5\times10^{-8}$ and \texttt{atol}=0, unless otherwise stated. This method can be run in parallel with shared memory,
so a convergence test was made in a cluster's node with 64 logical processors, varying the values of the metaparameters (e.g. halving and doubling the values of \texttt{maxiter} and \texttt{popsize}, setting \texttt{strategy}=\texttt{"best1bin"} and combinations).

The other algorithm is an implementation of the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm called
\texttt{NOMAD}~\citep{audet2021nomad}. The {\sc Julia}~\citep{bezanson2017julia}
wrapper of this algorithm, \href{https://bbopt.github.io/NOMAD.jl/stable/}{\it NOMAD.jl},
is used through the package \href{https://docs.sciml.ai/Optimization/stable/}{\it Optimization.jl}.
We used default values of all the metaparameters except for \texttt{maxiters}=700.

% The other algorithm is \texttt{LN\_NELDERMEAD}~\citep{NELDERMEAD,10.1093/comjnl/8.1.42,shere} from the
% {\it NLopt.jl}~\citep{NLopt} package
% for the {\sc Julia}~\citep{bezanson2017julia} language.
% We used default values for the all its metaparameters except for
% \texttt{reltol}=$5\times10^{-5}$.



\section{Results and discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Fitting the Fermionic-MW model}
In this section we will fit both the Fermionic-MW model parameters and the initial condition (IC) of the progenitor orbit through a series of steps.
Initially, we searched for a (transitory) good enough IC of the progenitor orbit for our
Fermionic-MW. For that, we fitted the initial conditions in the (fixed) NFW-MW model defined in
Sec.~\ref{sec:MW_stream_models} by using the $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}$ function defined in Eq.~(\ref{chi2})
and the genetic algorithm specified in Sec.~\ref{sec:optimization}. The genetic algorithm
needs to be provided with bounds for the variables so we used boxes with a centre close to the middle point
of the observable data, i.e. $\eta^{(51)}$ that corresponds to $\alpha=149.24^{\circ}$, $\delta=36.61^{\circ}$, $D=7.69$ kpc, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha=-5.70$ mas/yr, $\mu_\delta=-12.48$ mas/yr and $v_h=-18.81$ km/s, and with generous sides of length equal to their absolute values (except for $\alpha$ where we used a side of lenght $\alpha/5$).

It should be said that the NFW-MW model was fitted by~\citet{2019MNRAS.486.2995M} with a set of Gaia
DR2 data different from the polynomials used here. Any point along the stream is equally good as an IC. The genetic algorithm converged to a solution given approximately by
$\alpha=149.17^{\circ}$, $\delta=36.51^{\circ}$, $D=7.95$ kpc, $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha=-6.94$ mas/yr, $\mu_\delta=-12.49$ mas/yr and $v_h=-18.33$ km/s with a value of $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}\approx 17.52$.
The orbit that corresponds to this IC is displayed in the observable space in Fig.~\ref{fig:obs_astrometry}~(top: $\phi_2$, middle: $\tilde{\mu}_\alpha$, bottom: $\mu_\delta$) and Fig.~\ref{fig:obs_radial}~(top: $D$, bottom: $v_h$) with a dotted (green) line. The solid (black) line shows the corresponding observable $\eta$ data while the shaded (grey) area demarkates the corresponding $1\sigma_\eta$ regions.

From previous works~\citep{arguelles_novel_2018,2019PDU....24..278A,2023ApJ...945....1K} we know that the fermionic DM model parameters can be approximately grouped in two sets with different functionality. One group is formed
by $\epsilon$ and $\beta_0$ that control the core of the distribution in the sense that
for given values of $m_{\rm{core}}$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:observables}) and $\epsilon$, it is possible to find a value of $\beta_0$ in agreement; with a very small influence of the other two parameters: $\theta_0$ and $W_0$. This implies a partial degeneracy between $\epsilon$ and $\beta_0$.
The other group is formed by $\theta_0$ and $W_0$, which have small effect on the core region but
determine the distribution behaviour in the halo region. Additionally, there is also an approximate
degeneracy between these two variables in the sense that it is the parameter
$\omega_0 = W_0-\theta_0$ which mainly controls the halo profile, as will be further shown in this paper.

As a starting point for the parameter fit, we took the result from~\citet{2020A&A...641A..34B} who found that for $(\epsilon, \beta_0, \theta_0, W_0)=(56, 1.1977\times10^{-5}, 37.765, 66.3407)$
their MW model (DM+barions) satisfies both the geodesic motion of S2 and G2 at Sagittarius A*, i.e. $m_{\rm core}=3.5\times 10^5 M_\odot$, and the rotation curve from~\citet{sofue_rotation_2013}.
As a first step, we fixed values for $\epsilon=56$ and
fixed the IC that was recently fitted for the NFW-MW model, in order to perform a genetic minimization of the
$\chi^2_{\rm{full}}$ function in the window:
$(\theta_0,\omega_0, \beta_0)\in [35, 40]\times[25, 30]\times[10^{-5}, 1.5\times10^{-5}]$. Using metaparameter values \texttt{maxiter}=\texttt{popsize}=400, the algorithm converged to
$(\theta_0, \omega_0, \beta_0)\approx (36.0665,27.3471 , 1.25713\times10^{-5})$
 with a value of $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}\approx 21.9585$ and  $\chi^2_{\rm{core}}\approx 1.117$.
 Although the stream fit is good (as will later be shown), the associated value of the core mass was
 $m_c\approx 3.537\times 10^6 M\odot$ which implies that there is room for improvement.
We took this result to shrink the window to $(\theta_0,\omega_0, \beta_0)\in [35, 37]\times[26, 28]\times[1.2\times 10^{-5}, 1.3\times10^{-5}]$ and re-run the genetic algorith, converging
to $(\theta_0, \omega_0, \beta_0)\approx (36.0661, 27.3468,1.25769\times10^{-5})$ with a value of $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}\approx 21.9585$ and  $\chi^2_{\rm{core}}\approx 1.344\times10^{-5}$ which corresponds to
 a much precise value of the core mass, $m_c\approx 3.5001\times 10^6  M\odot$. It can be noticed the great sensitivity of the core mass depence on the model parameters because a change in the fifth significant digit of the parameters propagates to a change of in  the third significant digit of $m_c$. Nevertheless, both solutions above are astrophysically equivalent because~\citet{2021MNRAS.505L..64B} has prooved that core masses in the range $[3.5, 3.55]\times 10^6 M\odot$ give good fits of the S-stars.

The last step consisted in fixing the Fermionic-MW parameters while floating the ICs of the orbit with the genetic scheme, with metaparameter values \texttt{maxiter}=\texttt{popsize}=400, which gave us very similar to the FMW-MW case:
$\alpha=149.21^{\circ}$, $\delta=36.69^{\circ}$, $D=7.95$ kpc,
$\tilde{\mu}_\alpha=-6.94$ mas/yr, $\mu_\delta=-12.45$ mas/yr and $v_h=-19.15$ km/s, with an improved
value of $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}\approx 19.32$.
The corresponding orbit is displayed in the observable space in
Figs.~\ref{fig:obs_astrometry}-\ref{fig:obs_radial}~with a dashed (amber) line where it can be noticed that both the Fermionic-MW and NFW-MW models fit the GD-1 stream very well.
We have not performed any statistically rigourous comparison between both models to determine which one is
more consistent with the data. In fact, here we used a fixed NFW-MW model that was fitted by~\citet{2019MNRAS.486.2995M} with another set of Gaia DR2 observations, as has previously been stated.\\

We would like to give a glimpse of the behaviour of the $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}$ function so we have evaluated it for fixed values of $(\epsilon, \beta_0)=(56, 1.258\times10^{-5})$ in a bidimensional grid
spanning the box $(\theta_0, \omega_0)\in[34, 38]\times[25, 30]$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:chi2stream} shows a contourplot of this grid coloured by the value of their corresponding $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}$ and the black point corresponds to our fitted solution.
It can be noticed that the minimum values of the function are located along a thin and finite {\it valley}, implying that the solution of the fitting problem is locally degenerate along
a straight line in the $(\theta_0, \omega_0)$-plane. In spite of this, it was possible
to fit the Fermionic-MW model with a quality as good as in the NFW-MW model.
As an additional check, we have fitted a line to those points that satisfy $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}<50$
obtaining $h(x)\approx 0.7989+0.7361x$, substracted this line to $\omega_0$ and made a plot of $\chi^2_{\rm{stream}}$ function for $(\epsilon, \beta_0)=(56, 1.258\times10^{-5})$ in the window $(\theta_0, \omega_0-h(\theta_0))\in[35, 37]\times[-0.011,0.011]$. The result can be seen in the contour plot of
Fig.~\ref{fig:chi2stream_tilted}. It is noticeable that the variance along $\omega_0-h(\theta_0)$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than the variance along $\theta_0$.

\subsection{Virial quantities}
Our dark matter solution has a finite (virial) radius of $r_{\rm{DM,vir}}=27.4$ kpc and a virial mass
of $m_{\rm{DM,vir}}=1.4\times10^{11} M_\odot$. The total baryon mass of our model is approximately
$m_b=0.9\times10^{11}M_\odot$, implying that the total virial mass amounts to
$m_{\rm{vir}}=2.3\times10^{11} M_\odot$. The value of the MW total mass at 50 kpc reported in Table 3
of~\citet{2014MNRAS.445.3788G} is $2.9\times10^{11} M_\odot$ with $(\sigma, 2\sigma)=(0.4,0.9)\times10^{11} M_\odot$, so our solution is contained in the $2\sigma$ region.
It should be noted that as our solution's mass gets constant for radius larger
$r_{\rm{DM,vir}}$ while the model studied by~\citet{2014MNRAS.445.3788G} reaches larger estimated
masses according to their Table 3. Nevetheless it should be noted that their estimations have relatively
high error bounds, e.g. $2\sigma=3\times10^{11} M_\odot$ for $M(200\rm{kpc})=5.6\times10^{11} M_\odot$.

\subsection{Rotation curves}
As a way to compare our stream results with a more classical MW observable, we have compute the rotation curves for both models and plot them together with three independent rotation curve observations in
Fig.~\ref{fig:rotcurve}.
For the MW models we have used the same linestyles and colours that were used in previous figures:
dotted (green) for the NFW-MW and dashed (amber) for the Fermionic-MW.
The rotation curve data is given according to the following marker styles: squares (magenta)
for~\citet{sofue_rotation_2013}, circles (blue) for~\citet{Eilers_2019} and rhombus (light-blue)
for~\citet{sofue_2020}. Note that for building this rotation observables~\citet{sofue_rotation_2013}
assumes a value of ($R_\odot$,~$v_c(R_\odot)$)=(8 kpc, 200 km/s) and~\citet{sofue_2020} assumes
a value of ($R_\odot$,~$v_c(R_\odot)$)=(8 kpc, 238 km/s), while~\citet{Eilers_2019}
assumes $R_\odot=8,122$~kpc and a Galactocentric sun velocity $v_\odot$ = $(11.1, 245.8, 7.8)$~km/s,
in order to estimate a value of $v_c(R_\odot)=229\pm0.2$ km/s.

According to GD-1 observables, the present Galactocentric distance projected onto the plane $z=0$,
belongs to the interval $11.5 \lesssim D_g \lesssim 16.4$ (kpc), displayed as a vertical shaded (grey) band in
Fig.~\ref{fig:rotcurve}.
Although the GD-1 stream orbit location corresponds to $z\in [2.6, 9.7]$ kpc and thus explores the non-sphericality of the full MW models (due to baryons/NFW axisymmetry), the fact that both models approximately agree in their circular velocity values in the GD-1 region gives support to the idea of using stellar streams as Galactic
accelerometers~\citep{Ibata_2016,2022ApJ...940...22N,2023ApJ...945L..32C}.
It is interesting to note a coincidence between both models in their values of circular velocity
at the position of the sun as they both give a value of $v_c(R_\odot)\approx 244$~km/s.
Besides, this values are in perfect agreement with the independent estimate found
by~\citet{2020arXiv201202169B}, which are $v_c(R_\odot)=244\pm 8$~km/s for $R_\odot \approx 8.275$~kpc, or $v_c(R_\odot)=242\pm 8$~km/s for the addopted value of $R_\odot$ in the present paper.

The region where the GD-1 stream is located at cero redshift is displayed with a vertical grey band.}

\subsection{Varying the fermion mass to reach more compact cores}
As already mentioned, we have found a solution that is in agreement with both GD-1 data and
the geodesic motion of S2 and G2 at Sagittarious A*. But it is also true that any fermionic solution
with a core mass $m_c\approx m_{\rm{core}}$ and more compact than our solution for $m=56$ keV, will
also satisfy the S-stars contraint. It is interesting to find out how much compactness can be reached
while keeping simultaneously the S-stars and GD-1 contraints in the light of the new observations
of the Event Horizon Telescope which suggest a compactness of the order of magnitude of 5 Schwarzschild radii.
A precise ray tracing study about simulated images of the central
cores of fermionic distributions is on progress, trying to put strict constraints on the minimum
compactness needed so as to be in agreement with the EHT observations.
In order to extend our solutions to other values of the fermion mass ($m$), we used the second optimization algorithm described in Sec.~\ref{sec:optimization} for $\epsilon=100, 200, 300, 360$ keV. For each fermion mass we divided a given macroscopic orthohedron in parameter space in $20^3=8000$ smaller orthoedrons. Each subregion was optimized in a parallel distributed scheme, searching for those parameters that minimize $\chi^2_{\rm{full}}$ with the \texttt{NOMAD} algorithm. Afterwards, we selected the global minimum by comparing the results of each distributed process.
% In order to extend our solutions to other values of the fermion mass ($m$), we try the hypothesis that
% the optimal solution for $m$ is close to the corresponding solution for $m+\Delta m$ as long as $\Delta m$
% is small enough. Thus, we can start with our solution for $m=56$ keV, increase sequentially the mass with $\Delta m=0.1$ keV, and fit the other model parameters ($\theta_0, \omega_0, \beta_0$) at each step. In this case we use the second optimization algorithm described in Sec.~\ref{sec:optimization} for $56<m<370$ keV.
The result is that for all the fermion masses it is possible to find values of the other parameters in such a way that the GD-1 stream is fitted with the same quality as the initial ($m=56$) case. In fact, as will be shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:going_compact}, all the solutions have the same density profile in the halo region, while their difference is limited to the compactness of the core.

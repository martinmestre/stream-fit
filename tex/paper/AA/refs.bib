	abstract = {We have recently introduced a new model for the distribution of dark matter (DM) in galaxies based on a self-gravitating system of massive fermions at finite temperatures, the Ruffini–Argüelles–Rueda (RAR) model. We show that this model, for fermion masses in the keV range, explains the DM halo of the Galaxy and predicts the existence of a denser quantum core at the center. We demonstrate here that the introduction of a cutoff in the fermion phase-space distribution, necessary to account for the finite Galaxy size, defines a new solution with a central core which represents an alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario for SgrA*. For a fermion mass in the range mc2=48–345 keV, the DM halo distribution is in agreement with the Milky Way rotation curve data, while harbors a dense quantum core of about 4×106M⊙ within the S2-star pericenter.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The density variations in thin stellar streams may encode important information on the nature of dark matter. For instance, if dark matter aggregates into massive subhalos, these perturbers are expected to scatter stars out of dynamically cold stellar streams, possibly leading to detectable gaps in those structures. Here, we reexamine the density variations in the GD-1 stream, using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) astrometry and Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System photometry, together with high-precision radial velocities measured with the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope/ESPaDOnS and Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph instruments and complemented with public radial velocity catalogs. We show that after correcting for projection effects, the density profile exhibits high contrast periodic peaks, separated by 2.64 ± 0.18 kpc. An N-body simulation is presented that reproduces this striking morphology with simple epicyclic motion in a smooth Galactic potential. We also discuss the reliability of measuring density variations using ground-based photometric surveys, and for the particular case of GD-1 we highlight some of the artifacts present in the Gaia DR2 catalog along its track. Massive dark subhalos do not appear to be required to explain the density clumping along GD-1.}

We show that the classical determination of its component V⊙ in the direction of Galactic rotation via Strömberg's relation is undermined by the metallicity gradient in the disc, which introduces a correlation between the colour of a group of stars and the radial gradients of its properties. Comparing the local stellar kinematics to a chemodynamical model which accounts for these effects, we obtain (U, V, W)⊙= (11.1+0.69−0.75, 12.24+0.47−0.47, 7.25+0.37−0.36) km s−1, with additional systematic uncertainties ∼(1, 2, 0.5) km s−1. In particular, V⊙ is 7 km s−1 larger than previously estimated. The new values of (U, V, W)⊙ are extremely insensitive to the metallicity gradient within the disc.}",

Our deep data recovers the lower main sequence of the stream with unprecedented quality, clearly separating it from Milky Way foreground and background stars. An analysis of the distance to different parts of the stream shows that GD-1 lies at a heliocentric distance between 8 and 10 kpc, with only a shallow gradient across 45° on the sky. Matched filter maps of the stream density show clear density variations, such as deviations from a single orbital track and tentative evidence for stream fanning. We also detect a clear underdensity in the middle of the stream track at φ1 = −45° surrounded by overdense stream segments on either side. This location is a promising candidate for the elusive missing progenitor of the GD-1 stream. We conclude that the GD-1 stream has clearly been disturbed by interactions with the Milky Way disc or other subhaloes.}",

abstract = {Tidally disrupted globular clusters are transformed into thin, dynamically cold streams of stars that are extremely valuable tracers of the large- and small-scale distribution of mass in the Galaxy. Using data from the Gaia second data release combined with Pan-STARRS photometry, we present a sample of highly probable members of the longest cold stream in the Milky Way, GD-1. The resulting map of GD-1: (1) extends the apparent length of the stream by 20°, (2) reveals plausible locations for the progenitor, (3) detects high-contrast gaps along the stream, and (4) indicates the existence of stream members perturbed off the main stream track. These discoveries are only possible because of the exquisite astrometry from Gaia, which permits a clean separation of the stream from Milky Way stars. The additional length and a proper treatment of the progenitor will aid in dynamical modeling of GD-1 for mapping the large-scale dark matter distribution. The complex morphology of the stream points to a turbulent history; detailed phase-space properties of the perturbed stream members could potentially constrain dark matter substructure in the Milky Way.}

Here, we test the method with real proper motion data from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and by selecting targets down to r0 = 18.5 mag we show that it is able to detect the GD-1 stellar stream, whereas the structure remains below a useful detection limit when using a Matched Filter technique. The radial velocity solutions provided by STREAMFINDER for GD-1 candidate members are found to be in good agreement with observations. Furthermore, our algorithm detects a \\$\\{\\sim \\} 40^\\{^\\circ \\}\\$ long structure approximately parallel to GD-1, and which fans out from it, possibly a sign of stream-fanning due to the triaxiality of the Galactic potential.

We combined it with data for the outer disk, and constructed a logarithmic rotation curve of the entire Galaxy. The new rotation curve covers a wide range of radius from r 1 pc to several hundred kpc without a gap of data points. It links, for the ﬁrst time, the kinematical characteristics of the Galaxy from the central black hole to the bulge, disk and dark halo. Using this grand rotation curve, we calculated the radial distribution of the surface mass density in the entire Galaxy, where the radius and derived mass densities vary over a dynamical range with several orders of magnitudes. We show that the galactic bulge is deconvolved into two components: the inner (core) and main bulges. Both of the two bulge components are represented by exponential density proﬁles, but the de Vaucouleurs law was found to fail to represent the mass proﬁle of the galactic bulge.},

ABSTRACT = {We review the current status of the study of rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way, and present a unified RC from the Galactic Center to the galacto-centric distance of about 100 kpc. The RC is used to directly calculate the distribution of the surface mass density (SMD). We then propose a method to derive the distribution of dark matter (DM) density in the in the Milky Way using the SMD distribution. The best-fit dark halo profile yielded a local DM density of &rho; ⊙ = 0.36 &plusmn; 0.02 GeV cm &minus; 3 . We also review the estimations of the local DM density in the last decade, and show that the value is converging to a value at &rho; ⊙ = 0.39 &plusmn; 0.09 GeV cm &minus; 3 .},

abstract = {We measure the circular velocity curve vc(R) of the Milky Way with the highest precision to date across Galactocentric distances of 5 ≤ R ≤ 25 kpc. Our analysis draws on the six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of ≳23,000 luminous red giant stars, for which we previously determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven model that combines spectral data from APOGEE with photometric information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be  =  with systematic uncertainties at the ∼2%–5% level. We find that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at (−1.7 ± 0.1) km s−1 kpc−1, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 km s−1 kpc−1, beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric potential. Combining our results with external measurements of the mass distribution for the baryonic components of the Milky Way from other studies, we estimate the Galaxy’s dark halo mass within the virial radius to be  =  and a local dark matter density of  = .}

title = {FEELING THE PULL: A STUDY OF NATURAL GALACTIC ACCELEROMETERS. I. PHOTOMETRY OF THE DELICATE STELLAR STREAM OF THE PALOMAR 5 GLOBULAR CLUSTER*},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present an analysis of wide-field photometric surveys of the Palomar 5 globular cluster and its stellar stream, based on - and -band measures together with narrow-band DDO 51 photometry. In this first study, we use the deep (g, r) data to measure the incidence of gaps and peaks along the stream. Examining the star-counts profile of the stream plus contaminating populations, we find no evidence for significant underdensities, and find only a single significant overdensity. This is at odds with earlier studies based on matched-filter maps derived from shallower SDSS data if the contaminating population possesses plausible spatial properties. The lack of substantial substructure along the stream may be used in future dynamical simulations to examine the incidence of dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic halo. We also present a measurement of the relative distances along the stream, which we use to create the deepest wide-field map of this system to date.}

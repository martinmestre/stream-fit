	abstract = {We have recently introduced a new model for the distribution of dark matter (DM) in galaxies based on a self-gravitating system of massive fermions at finite temperatures, the Ruffini–Argüelles–Rueda (RAR) model. We show that this model, for fermion masses in the keV range, explains the DM halo of the Galaxy and predicts the existence of a denser quantum core at the center. We demonstrate here that the introduction of a cutoff in the fermion phase-space distribution, necessary to account for the finite Galaxy size, defines a new solution with a central core which represents an alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario for SgrA*. For a fermion mass in the range mc2=48–345 keV, the DM halo distribution is in agreement with the Milky Way rotation curve data, while harbors a dense quantum core of about 4×106M⊙ within the S2-star pericenter.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The density variations in thin stellar streams may encode important information on the nature of dark matter. For instance, if dark matter aggregates into massive subhalos, these perturbers are expected to scatter stars out of dynamically cold stellar streams, possibly leading to detectable gaps in those structures. Here, we reexamine the density variations in the GD-1 stream, using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) astrometry and Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System photometry, together with high-precision radial velocities measured with the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope/ESPaDOnS and Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph instruments and complemented with public radial velocity catalogs. We show that after correcting for projection effects, the density profile exhibits high contrast periodic peaks, separated by 2.64 ± 0.18 kpc. An N-body simulation is presented that reproduces this striking morphology with simple epicyclic motion in a smooth Galactic potential. We also discuss the reliability of measuring density variations using ground-based photometric surveys, and for the particular case of GD-1 we highlight some of the artifacts present in the Gaia DR2 catalog along its track. Massive dark subhalos do not appear to be required to explain the density clumping along GD-1.}

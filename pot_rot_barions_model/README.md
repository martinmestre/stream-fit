# Optimization of potential according to GD-1 stream and rotation curve.

## Potential = Dark Matter (RAR) + barions (bulge + two disks)
## Parameters: 2D-slice for RAR and 6D for the two disks.
## Chi^2 = Chi^2(Stream)+weight*Chi^2(rotation curve)
## Tests with four different values of weight.

## Runs in 3 different computers:

### antikythera: maxiter=30, popsize=50
### laruidosa:   maxiter=100, popsize=200
### serafin:     maxiter=100, popsize=200

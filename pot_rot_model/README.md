# Optimization of potential according to GD-1 stream and rotation curve.

## Potential = Dark Matter (RAR) + barions (bulge + two disks)
## Parameters: 2D-slice for RAR, barions fixed.
## Chi^2 = Chi^2(Stream)+weight*Chi^2(rotation curve)
## Tests with four different values of weight.

## Factor 1/3 in definition of "b" constant was corrected.
## The pressure now is ok.
